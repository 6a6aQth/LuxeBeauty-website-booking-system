## 4. Key Components

*   **`app/admin/page.tsx`**: The main administrative dashboard. This component handles the display of bookings, management of unavailable dates, and potentially other admin-specific tasks. Recent changes indicate a focus on synchronizing managed time slots with unavailable dates and robust error handling for availability updates.
*   **`components/booking-form.tsx`**: This component is crucial for client interaction, allowing users to select services, dates, and time slots for their bookings.
*   **`app/api/bookings/route.ts`**: Handles the API logic for creating, retrieving, and possibly updating/deleting booking records in the database.
*   **`app/api/unavailable-dates/route.ts`**: Manages the unavailable dates and time slots, which is critical for preventing double bookings and allowing administrators to block out specific times.
*   **`lib/prisma.ts`**: Initializes the Prisma client, providing the interface for all database operations throughout the application.
*   **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: Defines the application's database schema, including models for bookings, services, users, and unavailable dates.
*   **`emails/newsletter-template.tsx`**: This defines the structure and content of the newsletter emails sent to subscribers.

## 5. Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd luxebeautyy
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
    Then, install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project based on `.env.example` (if available, otherwise create it manually). You will need to configure your database connection string, Resend API key, and Vercel Blob API keys.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?schema=public"
    RESEND_API_KEY="YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY"
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="YOUR_VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN"
    ```
    *Note: Replace placeholders with your actual credentials.*

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running.
    *   Run Prisma migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:
        ```bash
        pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
        ```
    *   Seed the database with initial data (optional but recommended for development):
        ```bash
        pnpm prisma db seed
        ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 6. Deployment Instructions

This project is built with Next.js, making it highly compatible with Vercel for deployment.

1.  **Vercel Deployment:**
    *   Ensure your project is hosted on a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   Log in to your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/) (or sign up if you don't have one).
    *   Import your Git repository into Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.
    *   Configure environment variables in Vercel settings (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`).
    *   Vercel will build and deploy your application automatically on every push to your configured branch (usually `main`).

2.  **Other Platforms:**
    The project can also be deployed to other platforms supporting Node.js applications with custom servers or Docker. Refer to Next.js deployment documentation for more details on specific platforms.

## 9. Common Issues & Troubleshooting

*   **Database Connection Errors:**
    *   **Issue:** `PrismaClientKnownRequestError: P2002` (Unique constraint failed) or `P1001` (Can't reach database server).
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is correct.
        *   Verify your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.
        *   Check firewall rules if deployed remotely.
        *   Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` to ensure your database schema is up-to-date.
*   **Environment Variable Not Loaded:**
    *   **Issue:** API keys or other configurations are `undefined`.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Ensure `.env` file is correctly placed in the project root and values are set. Restart the development server after modifying `.env`.
*   **API Route Not Found (404):**
    *   **Issue:** Fetch requests to API routes return 404.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Verify the file path of your API route (e.g., `app/api/bookings/route.ts`). Next.js routes are file-system based.
        *   Check for typos in the fetch URL.
        *   Ensure the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) matches the handler in your `route.ts` file.
*   **Frontend-Backend Data Mismatch / Stale Data:**
    *   **Issue:** Data displayed on the frontend doesn't reflect the latest changes in the database.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Ensure you are re-fetching data after successful mutations (e.g., after saving unavailable dates in `app/admin/page.tsx`, `fetchAdminData()` is called).
        *   Check server-side caching mechanisms if any are implemented.
*   **Time Slot Management Issues:**
    *   **Issue:** Incorrect time slots being marked as unavailable or booked.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Review the `generateTimeSlots` utility in `lib/time-slots.ts`.
        *   Examine the logic in `app/admin/page.tsx` that manages `selectedTimeSlots` (now `managedSlots`) and `unavailableDates`, especially the `useEffect` hooks and the `handleSaveAvailability` function. Ensure synchronization between local state and database.
*   **Image Upload Issues:**
    *   **Issue:** Images not uploading or accessible.
    *   **Troubleshooting:**
        *   Verify `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correctly configured for Vercel Blob.
        *   Check the API route for image uploads (`app/api/price-list/upload/route.ts` or `app/api/bookings/upload/route.ts`) for correct handling of `FormData` and `vercel/blob` API usage.

## What We've Done Recently

*   **Improved Unavailable Dates Management:** Enhanced the admin panel (`app/admin/page.tsx`) to better manage and synchronize unavailable time slots. This involved:
    *   Switching from `selectedTimeSlots` to `managedSlots` for better clarity in state management.
    *   Implementing a new `useEffect` hook to synchronize `managedSlots` with `unavailableDates` fetched from the API when the availability modal is opened.
    *   Refining the `handleSaveAvailability` function to correctly update the `unavailableDates` state after a successful save, ensuring the UI reflects the latest data.
    *   Adding `fetchAdminData()` call after saving availability to ensure the latest data is fetched.
    *   Fixing a minor display bug in the booking details within the modal (adding closing parenthesis).
    *   Correcting the checkbox logic for time slots to accurately reflect managed slots.
*   **Refactored API Call for Unavailable Dates:** Switched from a simple `fetch` to capturing the response and handling potential errors more robustly, including updating the local state based on the API's response for unavailable dates.
*   **Added `key` prop to `DialogContent`:** This ensures the dialog content re-mounts when the `selectedDate` changes, preventing stale state issues with time slot selection.
